## What is the quality (you can use F.A.I.R) of the information?
 
 -F: The medata and data is easily findable because the readme file explicility states that the "LA_CRS_recoded.dta" dataset      is used for all analyses.

 -A: The data is accessible and retrievable because the identifier communicates includes the data as one of the files of the replication data. The file is named "LA_CRS_recoded.tab". The data will be accessible even when the data is no longer available because it is saved within the files of the dataverse.

 -I: The data is interoperable because it is used for analysis and storage within the tables the replication process requires.

 -R: The data is reusable because the "SSQ - Louisiana Floods Replication.do": Stata .do file contains all commands for replicating table and figure, and Supplemental Appendix analyses.



## What is the provenance and collection method of the data?
 
 -The data is collected using the analyses in "Who'll Stop the Rain? Repeated Disasters and Attitudes Toward Government," published in Social Science Quarterly, by Joshua P. Darr, Sarah D. Cate, and Daniel S. Moak. 



## What are the hypotheses of the project?
The hypotheses of the project is that prior experience with government agencies establishes expectations of responsibility that endure years later. 

In Louisiana, two extreme weather events, 11 years apart, required intervention from the state and federal government: Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2016 floods. This study examines Louisianansâ€™ attitudes toward government. The hypothesis is that their experiences with government prior led them to have certain expectations from these agencies in the future. 


## What are the research methods?
Initially the "research" was getting the data. The study uses an original survey of Louisianans to assess the role of Katrina experience in performance assessments of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Louisiana state government in 2016.

After data collection, our research methods come in the form of data analysis. It looks like the main form of research done to the datasets was exploratory data analysis and regression techniques. This allowed them to determine whether there was a strongly positive or negative correlation.
