### Pre-Analysis Plan (April 18, 2019)
# Abstract
Objective: 
Examine how prior experience with government agencies shapes citizens’ assessments of government performance. Specifically, using data in Louisiana, when two extreme weather events, 11 years apart, required intervention from the state and federal government: Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the 2016 floods. Were Louisianans’ attitudes toward government response shaped by their prior experiences during a natural disaster?

# Data
Much of the data focuses on respondent characteristics such as partisanship, political knowledge, media consumption, and racial identity. The data for this study come from the Community Resilience Study conducted by the Public Policy Research Lab at LSU, using a randomly selected sample of adult Louisiana residents from January 8 through February 6, 2017. The sample included live‐interviewer surveys of 418 respondents contacted by landline telephone and 661 respondents contacted by cell phone (1,079 respondents total). The response rate was 19.1 percent of eligible residential households or personal cell phones in the sample for which an interview was completed. Margins of error were ±3.1 percent for the Louisiana sample and ±5.2 percent for the Baton Rouge Area sample.
